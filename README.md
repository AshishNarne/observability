Observability allows engineers to measure and monitor the behavior and performance of a system. This often involves collecting and analyzing data from several sources, including application, infrastructure, and network components.
With the increasing complexity of modern, distributed systems, itâ€™s critical to have insights into every part of the system so that detecting, diagnosing, and resolving issues can happen as quickly as possible. These insights can also help engineers optimize performance and make their system components run more efficiently.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, logs.
